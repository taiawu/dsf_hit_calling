This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# load packages
library(quantmod) # contains the findValleys function, which maybe we should just extract and put verbatim in a source file instead of loading this whole thing...?
library(minpack.lm) # contains the nlsLM function, which we use for our fitting
library(modelr)
library(signal)
source("dsf_caller.R")

library(tidyverse)
filter <- dplyr::filter # signal over-writes dplyr::filter
```


Enter names for the relevant files
```{r}
layout_filename <- "ENTER LAYOUT FILENAME.csv"
screen_file <- "ENTER SCREEN FILENAME.csv"

```

For processing a single screen
```{r}
layout <- make_layout(layout_filename)

plate1 <- read_screen( screen_file = screen_file, 
                       layout = layout, 
                       plate_name = "plate1")

#### problem: loess smoothers (of which there are at least two in the pipeline) with a span of 0.1 produces NaNs when the data is below a certain length!!! in this case, it is 60 data points
find_tms <- find_tms_closure(win3d = 5, 
                             n_meas = 69, 
                             min_T =  25, 
                             max_T = 84) #find_tms_closure(low_T = 25, high_T = 94, n_meas = 69, min_T =  25, max_T = 80)

plate1_tms <- find_tms(df_raw =  plate1) # use the closure to analyze the data. Output will have all four fits, as well as dRFU tmas 
```

Based on the raw data appearance, write the relevant closure
```{r}

```



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
